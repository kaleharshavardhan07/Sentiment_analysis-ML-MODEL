# **OpinionMapper**

## **Overview**
**OpinionMapper** is a sentiment analysis project aimed at classifying text data into three sentiment categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to preprocess and analyze textual data efficiently.

---

## **Features**
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies text into three sentiment categories.
- **Data Balancing**: Balances imbalanced datasets using oversampling techniques.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes text, removes noise like URLs, hashtags, and stopwords.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`  
  - **Natural Language Processing**: `nltk`  
  - **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`  
  - **Text Vectorization**: `TfidfVectorizer`, `CountVectorizer`  

---

## **Dataset**
- The dataset contains textual data and sentiment labels.  
  - **Columns**:
    - `text`: Input text data.  
    - `sentiment`: Sentiment label (Positive, Neutral, Negative).  

---

## **Installation**
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpinionMapper.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
   ```
3. Download the dataset and place it in the project directory.

## **How to Use**
1. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Cleans the text data by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and stopwords.
   - Balances the dataset by oversampling minority sentiment categories.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer** or **Count Vectorizer**.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM models.
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Run the Project**:
   ```python
   python main.py
   ```

## **Machine Learning Models**
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Used for its simplicity and effectiveness in linear problems.
- **Naive Bayes**:
  - Suitable for text classification with bag-of-words features.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
  - Effective for high-dimensional data classification.

## **Results**
| **Model**          | **Accuracy** | **Precision** | **Recall** | **F1-Score** |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression | xx.xx%       | xx.xx%        | xx.xx%     | xx.xx%       |
| Naive Bayes         | xx.xx%       | xx.xx%        | xx.xx%     | xx.xx%       |
| SVM                 | xx.xx%       | xx.xx%        | xx.xx%     | xx.xx%       |

## **Applications**
- Social media sentiment analysis.
- Product review insights for e-commerce platforms.
- Customer feedback evaluation for businesses.

---

## **Future Scope**
- Implementation of advanced deep learning models like **BERT** or **transformers**.
- Multi-language support for sentiment analysis.
- Deployment of a web-based API for real-time sentiment classification.
